# Filling the triangles after translating rotating the model
## We can easily see the triangles overlapping.

# The same as the first Picture but after implementing the Z-Buffer
## We can see more "strictness" on the edges of each triangle which is not found in the first picture

# Now this picture after transforming the model with the same transformations as before but with the zbuffer no triangles overlap.

# Now we will show the Cow model being colored in grayscale
## It's obvious that two of the cow's legs are black colored because they are the "far" legs
